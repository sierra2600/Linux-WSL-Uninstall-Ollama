# Linux-WSL-Uninstall-Ollama
!!! NOTICE !!! I WILL RECOMMEND READING
INTO THE SHELL SCRIPTS BEFORE BLINDLY
DOWNLOADING AND USING THEM! THIS SCRIPT
WILL COMPLETELY REMOVE EVERYTHING
PERTAINING TO OLLAMA FROM YOUR LINUX OR
WSL INSTALL!!!

I had to remove Ollama from a personal
computer, I found a guide online and
compared it to the install script, in
the end, I copied certain elements from
the install script and combined them
with the uninstall instructions
